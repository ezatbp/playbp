        <h1>So you want to play Rattleballs?</h1>
        <img class="champface" src="../images/char_icons/rattleballs.png ">

        <h2>Basic Gameplay</h2>
        <p>Rattles is a duelist , which means his purpose is to try to force 1v1s. Sit in lane and try and bait out poke with your Q. 1camps and Goo monster are your main priority, and you should try and aggressively position yourself in your enemy's jungle if possible to farm these camps. Rattles takes awhile to really scale, but once he hits 5 he becomes a very good champion, at 7 and 8 he becomes nearly unfightable in any 1v1 or even most 1v2s, so try and last until the late game. </p>
        <p>Remember that Q has 3 separate phases and theyre all good for different things:</p>
         <ol>
             <li>The first phase is your counterstance, performed by pressing Q once and waiting, this is the most important stance in most builds, for more info see <a href="#advancedtips">Advanced Tips</a>, if you are hit by a spell during your counterstance Rattleballs will cancel his stance early with no secondary effect.</li>
             <li>The second phase is your spin, performed by letting the timer run out on your counterstance, this does good damage while building AP and is also decent for 3camps and waveclear</li>
             <li>The third and final phase is your dash, performed by pressing Q a second time within 1.5 seconds of initiating counterstance, use this mostly for chasing or getting away, combined with your W and E in AP builds it makes for a very strong full combo that will kill most champions that arent dedicating backpack points into shields.</li>
         </ol>


        <h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>+ Arguably the best duelist in the game</li>
            <li>+ Built optimally has the fastest and safest Goo Monster and Kee-Oth kills</li>
            <li>+ Despite being melee, Rattleballs deals with ranged characters fairly well because of his Q, Shadowless Thrust</li>
            <li>- Poor waveclear outside of AP builds</li>
            <li>- Extremely vulnerable to CC</li>
            <li>= Moderate build diversity, AP rattleballs would be much better if the game wasn't blind pick</li>
            <li class="egg">- Can't throw eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Abilities</h2>
        <div class="skill_grid">
            <p><img src="../images/skill_icons/rattleballsp.png "></p>
            <p class="passive">Passive - Dodge, Parry</p>
            <p>A very simple passive that informs Rattles gameplay style, it is better for sustain than the entirety of the Vampire Rocker Gear backpack.</p>
            <p><img src="../images/skill_icons/rattleballsq.png "></p>
            <p class="q">Q - Shadowless Thrust</p>
            <p>Rattles main damaging skill in most builds, and combined with his passive are why he is such a strong duelist. Bait out autos for poke, or if ahead you can do devastating damage from a distance. The first half of the dash can go over smaller walls for ambushes or escape purposes.</p>
            <p><img src="../images/skill_icons/rattleballsw.png "></p>
            <p class="w">W - Dust Storm</p>
            <p>With the attack based builds, this ability is mostly used for the mini-stun displacing your opponent gives, and also to give extra procs of your passive. In the ability based builds W becomes a signifcant source of damage for rattleballs and combined with Q in those builds he can clear a wave or 3camp instantly</p>
            <p><a class="spin" href="https://youtu.be/cerkDJLuT_k"><img src="../images/skill_icons/rattleballse.png "></a></p>
            <p class="e" >E - The Sword Stuff</p>
            <p>While using attack based builds this ability is usually used for escaping/chasing, or much like W as an instant source of extra heals with your passive. In ability based builds this ult is extremely strong for all sorts of purposes besides fighting Kee-Oth.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="advancedtips"><a id ="advancedtips">Advanced Tips</a></h2>
        <p>Your counterstance gains all the attributes of a normal auto attack, but applied as a spell meaning it will still do damage even if you are blinded. To elaborate, this means if you have attack vamp, from either your passive or some other effect, you will heal off Q, if you use Ice Monarch Regalia (for some reason), Numb-Chucks will apply an attack speed slow, etc. Your counterstance can also damage towers as long as you are in range of them when the stance is triggered, you can use this for diving in and out of the enemy's base safely.</p>
        <p>Your W can interrupt channels, so don't be afraid to fight an ulting Marceline, or approach an ulting Gunter from the front, also remember to cancel BMO's W in teamfights. You can also trigger Magic Man's E during the roll animation early, but this has niche uses due to the explosion's size.</p>
        <p>Rattleballs unlike other characters with dashes cannot go over any sort of large wall, he can however go over and around small walls respectively with phase 1 and phase 3 of his Q, this allows you to do some fancy chasing/getaways. The double dash stance can also be used to do near instant damage to someone in melee range to get extra hits of your passive.</p>
        <p>Rattleballs can solo Kee-Oth at level 6 with his standard build or level 5 with bindle of bravery, but it's better to just farm until at least level 7 as Kee-Oth that early won't accomplish much.</p>

        <h2>Meta and Role</h2>
        <p>Rattleballs is a well-rounded duelist, with the ability to also dive if the need arises, he fits well into most teams but his strengths really show in teams whose gameplan is to play for points or to end late. AP Rattleballs arguably fits better in "normal" teamfight compositions, but AD Rattleballs is so much better at everything else that you will usually go one of those builds instead. Rattleballs hard-counters the majority of other melee characters, with the exceptions of Peppermint Butler and Hunson due to their aoe abilities, but they also can't kill Rattles unless they are significantly ahead anyways. Rattleballs does poorly into mages like LSP, Lich, and Ice King especially, but luckily the latter isn't very popular. </p>
        
        <h2>Item Builds</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Billy's Bag - 1/1/5/5/1/5/1/5/3/3 (4/0/2/0/4) : Rattleballs standard build, it gives you everything you need to duel, farm, and siege, replace the points in 3 with 2 or 4 as needed for certain matchups</li>
            <li>Bindle of Bravery - 1/1/3/3/1/3/1/3/5/5 (4/0/4/0/2) : Rattleballs full jungling/more bruiser build, essentially the same as the standard build but with slightly more bulk in exchange for less damage.</li>
            <li>Sorcerous Satchel or Nearly Ultimate Wizard Wear - 2/2/4/4/2/4/2/4/3/3 (0/4/2/4/0) and 2/2/3/3/2/3/2/3/4/4 (0/4/4/2/0) respectively : AP Rattleballs, fairly viable but does nothing without cooldowns being up, replace the points in NUWW defenses as needed for matchups.</li>
        </ul>
